                Exploration, as the name suggests, is the activity of searching and finding out about
                something. With the progress of the times, technology improves every day. New
                developments are constantly infiltrating our lives. We hope to foster an innovation and
                technology culture in the community. Not only encourage people to explore new
                technologies, but also hope that everyone can share and contribute every small part they
                can in information technology to make the world better. In this keynote, speakers can tell
                everybody technologies with innovation and share the stuffs in the community.
